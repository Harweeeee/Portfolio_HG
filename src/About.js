                                My name is Harleigh, and I'm currently 26 years
                                old. I'm a proud Aussie and currently live in SE
                                Queensland ðŸ¦˜. <br />
                                <br />
                                Professionally, I have worked in Administration
                                and Property Mangement over the last 8 years; as
                                you could imagine this has given me quite the
                                skill set surrounding organisation and people.
                                Two years ago, I was introduced to coding and
                                software development. I instantlty knew that it
                                was something I wanted to learn more about.
                                <br />I attended a free coding basics workshop
                                through 'SheCodes' and that solidified my
                                decision to keep learning. I was certainly
                                intimidated at first, but quickly eased into it
                                and completed the remaining workshops. Recently,
                                I graduated and obtained my SheCodes Diploma ðŸŽ‰
                                <br />
                                <br />I have enjoyed exploring the creative side
                                of myself as well, and fortunately I could
                                express this in my administration job by
                                creating aestetically pleasing documents and
                                social media posts. Little did I know that my
                                creative skills would become invaluable when it
                                came to web design as well.
                                <br />
                                <br /> Personality wise, I'm certainly more an
                                introvert than an extrovert, but I do like a fun
                                time. I enjoy reading and I have also been
                                fortunate enough to have travelled to multiple
                                countries (with plenty more to see!). I
                                absolutely love animals, and aspire to one day
                                buy lots of land so I can own as many as I can.
                                At the moment we have a rottweiler called Duke
                                and he is super cute.
                                <br />
                                <br /> I'm keen to keep improving my coding
                                skills and working on various projects. Watch
